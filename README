To initialize get started with Android/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, 
use a command like this:

repo init -u git://github.com/cyanogen/android.git -b donut

Then to sync up:

repo sync


After checking out the repositories, you'll need to create a
buildspec.mk file with contents like this:

TARGET_PRODUCT:=aosp_dream_us
TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT:=eng
TARGET_BUILD_TYPE:=release


To get all the proprietary binaries from your ADP1 device, run the
"extract-files.sh" script in the vendor/htc/dream-open directory.
This requires that you have the adb tool in your path and a
compatible system image on your ADP1 device (Android 1.6).


Once you have your environment setup, just run make!
